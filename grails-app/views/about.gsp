		<h1>About the Pieuvre</h1>

		<p><strong>Pieuvre</strong> <em>&nbsp;[pj&oelig;v&#640;]</em></p>
		<p>Pieuvre is the french word for octopus.</p>

		<h2>Purpose</h2>

		<p>Our purpose is to provide a new way of organising and reading information on the Internet.</p>

		<p>Today, there are so many sources of information, so many topics, so many different opinions, <em>etc.</em> on the Internet that it requires an important time to follow all this information. The Pieuvre is a multi-purposes tool answering these problematics.</p>

		<p>The Pieuvre organises and finds the information for you.</p>

		<h2>Openness</h2>

		<p>The Pieuvre gathers contents from all sort of Internet sources, thus it is natural for the Pieuvre to redistribute those contents.</p>

		<p>Our goal is to make the Pieuvre accessible to all sort of applications and let people find new way of displaying and sharing information.</p>

		<h2>History</h2>

		<p>The idea emerged in September 2012. Too many unread articles in an RSS reader and the observation that the same news/information was covered by several feeds. Then, why not sorting and grouping articles based on news?</p>

		<p>December 2012, let&rsquo;s start coding... January 2013 thepieuvre.com domain is acquired... February 2013 first demos... and keep writing its history...</p>
